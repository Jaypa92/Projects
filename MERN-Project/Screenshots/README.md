About Project: 
This is a website for musicians that get keep a record of their songs and create set lists for each show they will be performing across multiple
cities and towns. A lot of functionality was learned and put into this project

Pics With Explanations:

This is an example of the main page the user will see. More to come on this later

The user is allowed to view multiple set lists at a time if they wish

If a user no longer wants to view a set list they can click the "Hide" link and you can see what happens in this pic vs previous pics

If a user wishes to delete a set list they can click the "Delete" link and you'll notice compared to previous pics, it is no longer there

This is what happens when a user wishes to add a new set list. They just type the name of the list in the form and it automatically appears
ready for the user to add songs to it

If a user wishes to add a song to their lists of songs, they just have to fill out the form with the appropriate information
