About Project:

as read jokes from other users. Not to mention if they're feeling really down, they can utilize some the site's resources to receive help with their 
mental health.

Here is the intro to the site the users will see when they first visit the page. There is a warning for users to consent to for their understanding thst 
there is a possibility that some of the content shared by users may be offensive. Once accepted, the users are prompted with a second option to proceed.
