About:
While learning the basics of coding I have made a personal portfolio about myself which will be updated with the newer technologies I've learned as this
 as this was the very beginning of my coding journey.
 
 Pics with Explanation:
 
 The top portion and the first part any user will see is a quote which I feel like describes my goals as a software engineer

Next the user will see an about me with a picture of myself that upon hover, it changes to a different pic

The user will then stumble upon projects that I have worked on in the beginning as I was honing my skills
